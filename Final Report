Vehicle collisions are one of the top contributors to injuries and deaths in the US. In our data, we are able to analyze 
the collisions in Seattle over a 15 year time period. The significant attributes that I utitilized in order to model the data were
the number of people involved in the collision, the number of vehicles involved in the collision, the weather conditions at the time 
of the collision, the road conditions at the time of the collision, teh lighting conditions at the time of the collision, whether or not
the driver was speeding, and the type of road junction that the accident occured in. I utilized the following machine learning techniques 
in order to predict the likelihood of an accident based on these conditions: KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. 

I measured the accuracy of each model against one another with the jaccard prediction accuracy score. The following results were produced.

KNN:0.719815	
Decision Tree: 0.742468
Logistic Regression: 0.727854	

The accuracy of each model represented similar score, but the decision tree model had the best accuracy of about 75%. This represents this model 
having the best likelihood of explaining to someone when they are most likely to get into a vehicle crash.
