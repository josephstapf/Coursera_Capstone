 Introduction/Business Problem
 
      
 Driving a car and manuervering through traffic is a basic, necessary task that millions of people around the world perform 
 on a daily basis. Cars have been engineered to be safer and infrastructure has been made to last longer, yet vehicle crashes
 still account for millions of deaths around the world. Each year, more than 1.3 million people are killed on roadways around
 the world. In the US alone, there are 6 million car accidents a year, with those contributing to 37,000 deaths of Americans. 
 There are any safety precautions that people can take to be safer on the road (wearing a seatbelt, staying vigilant, being a 
 defensive driver, following the laws and regulations, etc.), but it would be also helpful to analyze the other factors in play
 with these millions of accidents. With my understanding of analytical concepts and machine learning algorithms, I will create a 
 model that explains uncontrollable factors that lead to an increase probabilty of getting in a car accident. Public knowledge of 
 these factors will help thousands of drivers a day make better decisions when on the road and help decrease road traffic related
 injuries.
