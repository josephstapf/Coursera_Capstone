# Data Description

The data I am using to approach this problem is a labeled data set. I am only incorporating labeled data because it is necessary
for my supervised machine learning approach. The label for the dataset is severity, which describes the severity/fatality of a 
car accident. Each row represents a collision during the time period of 2004 to the present. The current dataset has 37 
attributes, including weather conditions, road conditions, light conditions, time of day, location, weather or not the driver was 
speeding, etc. I hope to incorporate enough significant factors in order to build an accurate model taht clearly shows what 
contributes to the severity of these collisions.
